# The Stateful ElePHPant

This project explains states using a game (with normal if statements) and a PHP implementation
using the state pattern.

## Game

You can see the game here: [https://rskuipers.github.com/stateful-elephpant](https://rskuipers.github.com/stateful-elephpant)

## Usage

If you want to run the game locally, start a php service in the root of this project.

```sh
$ php -S 0:8080
```

And view the game here: [http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html)

You can also execute the PHP equivalant.

```sh
$ php index.php
```
